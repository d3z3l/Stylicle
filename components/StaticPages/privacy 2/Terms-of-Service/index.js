                    Appointment Booking.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Stylicle provides the Booking Services to Users for the purpose of assisting Customers in discovering and booking appointments with variety of participating SMBs and of assisting SMBs in more efficiently managing their calendars and increasing their customer base. In response to a Customer’s online request for a SMB appointment through the Stylicle Site or Stylicle Application, Stylicle directly contacts the SMB’s computerized database of appointments. The availability of appointments is determined at the time of User’s query and is provided by the SMB. Users understand and agree that Stylicle does not independently verify the availability of any SMB and cannot be held liable for errors in a SMB’s calendar, such as double-booking or bookings that are not honoured by the SMB. Once an appointment is made by a Customer through the Stylicle Site or Stylicle Application, Stylicle will provide confirmation of the appointment to both the Customer and SMB by email to the email address provided by said User upon registration. By using the Booking Services, Users agree to receive appointment confirmations and reminders by email, SMS, push notifications, and/or any chatbot-related or voice-assisted technology with which Stylicle may engage. Stylicle shall not be held liable in the event an appointment confirmation or reminder is not sent to or received by a User.

                    Appointment No-Show &amp; Cancellation Policy.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Stylicle is committed to providing quality services to Customers and SMBs. To assist us in maintaining a consistently high level of service for SMBs and their patrons, Customers must make every reasonable effort to cancel any appointments that they will be unable to honor as soon in advance of the appointment as possible. You may cancel your appointment via the Stylicle Site or Stylicle Application or by calling the SMB directly. Some SMBs may require a debit or credit card number to finalize your appointment booking and place a hold on the SMB’s calendar. In order to use the Booking Services for these SMBs, you must provide valid debit or credit card information and a specific amount could be blocked or prepaid, and you may be required to cancel your appointment in accordance with the SMB’s stated cancellation policy, which will be disclosed at the time the appointment is made. Stylicle uses this debit or credit card information as described in our Privacy Policy and shall have no liability for any charges made to the debit or credit card account for any failure to cancel your appointment in accordance with an SMB's cancellation policy. Be advised: you may be charged a cancellation fee indicated during the booking process or lose the amount blocked or paid, if you arrange a Booking Service, but cancel late or no-show, thus committing a breach of a stated cancellation policy of the SMB. In case it is not otherwise specified, the refund of any amount blocked or pre-paid rests solely with the SMB.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Customers who cancel or fail to show up for multiple bookings may have their Accounts terminated, at the sole discretion of Stylicle, in the event that such account activity is detrimental to orderly Booking Services with SMBs and members of the Stylicle community.

                    <br/><br/>
                    User agrees to use the Booking Services only to book appointments at SMBs and then honor those appointments by arriving at SMBs on time and paying for the services booked and provided. Resale or attempted resale of appointments is prohibited and is grounds for, among other things, cancellation of your appointments or termination of your access to the Services.

                    Stylicle Payment Services, Generally.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Stylicle may offer third-party payment services (the “Payment Services”) in order to allow Customers to pay bills at participating SMBs through the Stylicle Application. Specifically, Stylicle collects and processes payments on behalf of SMB through Adyen N.V., a recognized professional payment gateway provider. In order to use the Payment Services at a participating SMB, Customers must: (1) install the Stylicle Application on a compatible mobile device; (2) make a reservation for the SMB through the Booking Services; (3) provide valid payment information through the Stylicle Application as further described below; and (4) have an Account in good standing. There is no fee from Stylicle to Customer to use the Payment Services; however, Customer’s mobile carrier’s standard text message and data charges may apply; you are responsible for any fees charged by your mobile carrier in connection with your use of the Payment Services and Stylicle Application.

                    Sale Prices.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The prices and the terms of payment for SMB services are displayed at the time of booking via the Stylicle Application; however, SMBs may modify or change these fees at any time, in their sole discretion. The Stylicle Site and Stylicle Application support both included and excluded tax systems. In the former, the prices presented are the final prices including all sales taxes, and, in the latter, such taxes will be added to the final price after the service is rendered. The decision as to which system should be used is up to the SMB.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Payment Card Information.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In order to use the Payment Services, Customers must provide account information for at least one valid debit or credit card through the Stylicle Application. Stylicle uses this account information as described in our Privacy Policy. You may add, delete, and edit the debit or credit card account information you have provided from time to time through the Stylicle Application. If you provide account information for more than one valid debit or credit card, you must select which debit or credit card you want to use to pay your bill.
                    <br/><br/>
                    To confirm that the payment card information you have provided is accurate, we may place a temporary $1.00 authorization hold on your debit or credit card at the time you provide your payment card information through the Stylicle Application. After we verify that your payment card information is accurate, usually within a few days, the $1.00 hold will be removed. In no event will your payment card actually be charged for this $1.00 authorization.
                    <br/><br/>
                    To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to our Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree that we may use certain third-party vendors and service providers (such as payment gateway providers) to process payments and manage debit and credit card information.
                    <br/><br/>
                    By providing debit or credit card account information through the Stylicle Application, you represent, warrant, and covenant that: (1) you are legally authorized to provide such information to us; (2) you are legally authorized to perform payments from the debit or credit card account(s); and (3) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to your use of such debit or credit card account(s) or applicable law. When you authorize a payment using a debit or credit card account via the Stylicle Application, you represent, warrant, and covenant that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete a payment using the debit or credit card account. By using Booking Services, you acknowledge and accept the binding agreement to bear full financial responsibility for all Booking Services that you schedule using Stylicle or information contained on Stylicle.

                    Payment Authorization and Settlement.
                    <br/><br/>
                    When you indicate through the Stylicle Application that you intend to pay your bill using the Payment Services, you authorize Stylicle or the payment service provider to charge your debit or credit card for the full amount of the services to be rendered and any cancellation fees that you may incur at any time prior to or after the appointment time and date. You are responsible for timely payment of all amounts owed by you to Stylicle and SMBs.

                    Receipts and Transaction History.
                    <br/><br/>
                    All the receipts for the transactions connected with the Payment Services are visible in your Account in the Stylicle Application and/or Stylicle Site. If you would like an emailed version or a paper receipt, you must request one from the SMB at the time of the transaction or service.

                    Incomplete Payments.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Stylicle is not liable for any payments that the Payment Services do not complete because: (1) your debit or credit card account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the transaction or the transaction would exceed the credit limit or overdraft protection of the debit or credit card account; (2) you have not provided us with correct payment account information; (3) your debit or credit card has expired; or (4) circumstances beyond our control (such as, but not limited to, power outages, interruptions of cellular service, or any other interference from an outside force) prevent the execution of the transaction. To the extent that any amounts owed cannot be collected from your debit, or credit card account through the Payment Services, you are solely responsible for paying the applicable SMB(s) by other means, such as cash, as required for the full value of the services scheduled and/or delivered.

                    <br/><br/>
                    All sales and accepted bookings shall be binding. SMB agrees and acknowledges that he, she, or it, and not us, shall be solely responsible for delivery of any and all purchased services to Customers and that a contract for sale arises at the point where a Customer utilizes the Booking Services to book a service. Every sale shall be subject to the laws applicable, but there shall not be implied any right that is not a legal right and that is not set down in these Terms.

                    In addition to the Unauthorized Business and prohibited use of the Services set forth in these Terms, SMB warrants that any and all services (a) are not: illegal, obscene, abusive, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to any third party; (b) have not been identified by the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission and any other regulations set forth by the countries of SMB and Customer as hazardous to consumers and, therefore, are not services subject to a recall; (c) are not counterfeit; (d) do not offend against the law of any country whose citizens might purchase or receive the services; and (e) do not violate the rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). SMB warrants further that he, she, or it owns all copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property related to any SMB Account information provided to us or that SMB has the permission of the intellectual property rights holder (a) to place the Product(s) into the stream of commerce; (b) to receive the net proceeds of such sales as arise; and (c) to defend the intellectual property in the Product(s). Finally, SMB warrants and represents that he, she, or it has all licenses and authorizations required for performance of these Terms. Upon our request, SMB shall provide us with sufficient documentary evidence of such authorization or waiver. We are not obliged to require such documentary evidence, and the fact that we have not requested such documentary evidence shall not be deemed in any way as a statement as to whether or not such authorization or waiver is required.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Furthermore, it is illegal to use drug paraphernalia slang when referring to Products available for sale via the Web site.

                    <br/><br/>
                    By listing services available for booking via the Booking Services, SMB must accurately describe the services it provides and all terms of sale.

                    Ethical Selling Tactics Required; Communication with Customers.
                    <br/><br/>
                    SMBs shall utilize ethical selling tactics when promoting any and all services including refraining from the making of false and/or misleading statements regarding the services and/or SMB. SMBs expressly agree to conduct themselves at all times in an ethical, moral, and lawful manner. In order to assist with the same, Stylicle may from time to time in its sole and exclusive discretion place limits on the types of communications that SMBs may send to Customers, including but not limited to mass targeted marketing campaigns via SMS text, email, or push notification.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In addition to the forgoing, SMBs shall not abuse any communication system made available via the Stylicle Application or the Stylicle Site, including the use of auto-responders. SMBs understand that such auto-responders may or may not be activated automatically upon registration of a SMB Account, depending on jurisdiction, and can be modified by SMB via its account settings.

                    Compliance with Law.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In addition to the other requirements to comply with laws, regulations, and terms set forth herein, SMBs agree to obey any and all local, state, and federal regulations and laws regarding solicitation and sales.

                    <br/><br/>
                    SMB may refuse to accept a booking made via the Booking Services for any or no reason whatsoever so long as such a refusal does not violate federal, state, or local laws, or any other rule or regulation.

                    Policies, Terms of Sale Required.
                    <br/><br/>
                    SMBs must have in place via their service listing the following policies before they shall be permitted to conduct any transaction via the Services: pre-payment policies, cancellation policies, return policies, and payment policies in addition to such other policies as a SMB wishes to set forth. SMBs must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide by such policies. In the event a policy fails to comply with these Terms of Use and/or is unreasonable in any way we may, in our sole and exclusive discretion, require SMB to revise said policy.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Processing Fees for SMBs.
                    <br/><br/>
                    SMBs who wish to use our Payment Services shall be charged a fee for processing payments according to the current local pricing, (the “Processing Fee.”) For details, contact <a href="mailto:support@Stylicle.com">support@Stylicle.com</a> Such Processing Fee shall be subject to change without notice in our sole and exclusive discretion. Such Service Fee shall not be refundable to SMB, for any reason whatsoever, including in the instance SMB shall have to refund a purchase to a Customer.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Chargebacks and Revocations.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If a Customer is not the authorized user of the payment method or otherwise contests the transaction, the amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back provided that the transaction: (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason by the payment network, Stylicle’s payment gateway provider, or the Customer or its financial institution, (c) was not authorized or Stylicle has any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of these Terms. For any transaction that results in a chargeback, Stylicle will withhold the chargeback amount in a reserve from the amounts payable to SMB. We may recoup the amount of any chargeback and any associated fees and fines assessed by a network or our processor. In addition to the forgoing, be advised that Stylicle may charge a chargeback processing fee. If you have pending chargebacks, we may delay payments, and if we reasonably believe that a chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential chargeback from payments otherwise due to you until such time that: (a) a chargeback is assessed due to a Customer complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which your customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a chargeback for which you are liable, you agree to pay us the full amount of the chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by us for the collection of all amounts unpaid by you.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive amount of chargebacks, we may establish additional conditions governing your account, including (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated chargebacks and related fees, (c) delaying payouts, or (d) terminating or suspending the Payment Services.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We will assist you, when requested and at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Payment Services. To that end, you permit us to share information about a chargeback with the Customer, the Customer’s financial institution, our payment processor, payment networks and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the chargeback. If the chargeback is contested successfully, we will release corresponding reserved funds to your account. If a chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the chargeback, we may recover the chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these terms. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within seven (7) calendar days of our request, may result in an irreversible chargeback.
                </li> <li>
                    Withholding of Funds.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Where we, in our reasonable opinion, are required to do so by law, we reserve the right to withhold funds for services that we reasonably deem suspicious with regard to money laundering, Unauthorized Business, fraud, or other illegal activities or in case of any other chargebacks or revocations.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Payouts.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Once you create your SMB Account, through the secure form you will have the opportunity to designate a deposit account into which you wish to be paid out. Once funds for the Payment Services have been completed and are settled, they shall be available for withdraw. For U.S.-based SMBs, payouts shall automatically be transferred to your deposit account less any fees every business day. For all other SMBs, payouts are generally made to your designated deposit account less any fees within 2-3 business days.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Except as required by law, you shall remain solely and exclusively responsible for retaining permanent records of all transactions processed via your SMB Account Settings.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We are not responsible and accept no liability for any delay of payout. To inquire about a payout schedule for any particular transaction please review your Payment Report or contact Stylicle at <a href="mailto:support@Stylicle.com">support@Stylicle.com</a>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In the event your payout account becomes negative, you agree that we have the right to offset any incoming payments against the negative balance. Should you fail to bring your account to positive, we may block you from accepting further payments and institute legal proceedings for collection.
                </li> <li>
                    Responsibility for Accurate Pay Out Information.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate deposit account information for payout. You agree to promptly update your SMB Account and other information, including your address, email address and bank account information, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Deposits.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Stylicle may require the SMB to maintain deposits in an escrow account to act as a provision against chargebacks and refunds. The amount of such deposits will be determined by Stylicle.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Processing Errors.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We will attempt to fix processing errors we discover. If the error resulted in your receipt of fewer funds than you were entitled, we will credit your SMB Account for the difference. If the error results in your receipt of more funds than you were entitled, Stylicle will debit the extra funds from your SMB Account or your linked bank account. You shall remit to Stylicle the difference within thirty (30) calendar days of demand therefore. We will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if you notify us of such an error. Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty (30) calendar days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history may be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Refunds.
                    <br/><br/>
                    By accepting card transactions through the Payment Services, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for your goods or services in accordance with these Terms. You are obliged to disclose your refund or cancellation policy to Customers at the time of purchase and/or booking, as applicable, and can refund transactions up to thirty (30) calendar days following the date of said transaction. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the customer for postage that the customer paid to return merchandise. If your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the Customer, you may still receive a chargeback relating to such sales.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Stylicle will automatically process refunds on your behalf from your available balance or deposit amount and shall not be liable for refunds made in error or in violation of your own policies. If your available balance or deposit amount is insufficient to cover the refund, Stylicle will withdraw the requested refund amount and credit it back to your Customer. Further refunds may be accepted but will only be processed once your account shows a positive balance. For every refund Stylicle may charge a refund processing fee.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Stylicle has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf pursuant to the applicable Network Rules (as defined below.) By using the Payment Services, you agree to comply with all applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations set forth by the payment processing networks and Ayden N.V. (“Network Rules”). The payment processing networks amend their rules and regulations from time to time. Stylicle may be required to change these terms in connection with amendments to the Network Rules. Significant portions of the Network Rules are available to the public at https://visa.com, https://www.mastercard.com, and https://www.americanexpress.com/merchantopguide. In the event of inconsistency between a Network Rule and these terms, and except as otherwise agreed between Stylicle and the payment processing networks, the Network Rules shall apply.

                    Right to Set-Off; Collection Rights.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We are entitled to set-off any and all claims against amounts payable to Stylicle by SMB. In addition, to the maximum extent provided by law, we may collect any and all obligations due and owing by you to us by deducting them from your pending transactions in the deposit account. Fees shall be assessed at the time of transaction processing and will be deducted from the funds received. Your failure to pay all amounts due and owning shall be deemed an immediate breach of this Agreement for which you will be liable. You further agree to pay all fees and costs, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees and costs, incurred by or on our behalf arising from or related to the collection of any unpaid obligations by you.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Payment of Taxes.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You are responsible for determining any and all taxes assessed, incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld for any reason for your use of the Payment Services (“Taxes”). You also are solely responsible for collecting, withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction. If you are a SMB based in the United States and in a given calendar year you process (i) more than $20,000 in gross amount of payments and (ii) more than Two Hundred (200) payments, Stylicle or its payment processor may be required by law to report information about you and your use of the Payment Services to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). For purposes of determining whether you have met the IRS reporting threshold, the gross amount does not include any adjustments for credits, cash equivalents, discount amounts, fees, refunded amounts or any other amounts. Whether you reach $20,000 in payments or more than Two Hundred (200) payments will be determined by looking at our Payment Service information associated with your SMB Account. In order to be able to meet said regulatory obligations, before SMB meets the thresholds, we will need additional information, including a completed IRS form W9 for U.S.-based SMBs. We are entitled to block the Payment Services for a SMB that fails to provide us with all the needed information based on the applicable taxation rules and regulations.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Additional Products and Services, Generally.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We may, from time to time, offer additional products and services for purchase by SMBs, such as additional text messages, or payment processing hardware and technical support, and lead generation. Such additional products and services shall be subject to additional service fees, which shall be set out at the point of sale and subject to change in or sole and exclusive discretion and set forth in a separate agreement between the Customer and Stylicle or a Stylicle affiliate offering such products and services. In the event that such additional services include lead generation for SMBs, SMB agrees and acknowledges that it will be responsible for the payment of a commission to Stylicle for first-time Customers who utilize the Booking Services. In such an event, Stylicle and SMB shall agree in good faith on a set number of leads generated with Stylicle retaining ultimate authority to determine the same.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Transaction History.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You may, at any time, access your transaction history via your Account settings. Such history may include the ability to track commissions and inventory and otherwise receive statistics and reports on the performance of your SMB. While we endeavor to keep all such information complete, timely, and accurate, we do not warrant that all transaction history shall be error-free. You are encouraged to maintain your own transaction history and financial information and to verify the same with your corporate accountant. By using the Stylicle Application and Stylicle Site you acknowledge that your reliance on any such information provided by Stylicle is at your own risk. Stylicle shall not be held liable in the event such information is inaccurate or incomplete.

                    <br/><br/>
                    This Agreement is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware for those Users who enter into this Agreement with Stylicle, Inc., and the country of Poland for those Users who enter into this Agreement with Stylicle International Sp. z.o.o., without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
                    <br/><br/></li> <li>
                    Arbitration.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitration choice related to the controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and Stylicle or its successors or assigns shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitrating.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Arbitration shall be subject to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from UNCIRAL. As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the UNICTRAL’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”). You are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights except for matters that you file in small claims court. your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. you are entitled to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. You and Stylicle must abide by the following rules: (1) any claims brought by you or Stylicle must be brought in the party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding; (2) the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and may not award class-wide relief; (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Stylicle will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (4) Stylicle also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (6) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (7) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (8) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Stylicle may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in New York, New York in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York, New York for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
                    <br/><br/>
                    With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) in this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (1) or (2) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Stylicle shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in New York, New York.
